It seems like the Redis PHP extension is not installed or properly configured on your system, which is why you're seeing the `Class "Redis" not found` error.

To resolve this issue, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Install the Redis PHP Extension**
The Redis PHP extension must be installed to use the `Redis` class.

#### For PHP 8.2 (or the PHP version you're using):
- **Ubuntu/Debian:**

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install php8.2-redis
  ```

- **CentOS/RHEL:**

  ```bash
  sudo yum install php-redis
  ```

- **Fedora:**

  ```bash
  sudo dnf install php-redis
  ```

### 2. **Enable the Redis Extension (if needed)**
After installing the Redis PHP extension, you need to enable it in the `php.ini` file.

- Locate your `php.ini` file. For PHP-FPM, this will typically be at `/etc/php/8.2/fpm/php.ini` or `/etc/php/8.2/cli/php.ini` for CLI. If you're unsure, you can use the following command to find it:

  ```bash
  php --ini
  ```

- Open the `php.ini` file and ensure the following line is not commented out (remove the semicolon `;` if present):

  ```ini
  extension=redis.so
  ```

### 3. **Restart PHP-FPM and Web Server**
After installing and enabling the Redis extension, restart PHP-FPM and your web server (Nginx or Apache).

- Restart PHP-FPM:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart php8.2-fpm
  ```

- Restart Nginx or Apache (depending on your web server):

  - For Nginx:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```

  - For Apache:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    ```

### 4. **Verify the Redis Extension is Loaded**
To confirm that the Redis extension is installed and enabled, run the following command:

```bash
php -m | grep redis
```

You should see `redis` in the output, confirming that the extension is enabled.

### 5. **Test Redis in Laravel**
Now, you should be able to use Redis in your Laravel application without encountering the `Class "Redis" not found` error. You can test this by running a basic Redis command in a route or controller:

```php
Route::get('/test-redis', function () {
    Redis::set('name', 'Laravel');
    return Redis::get('name');
});
```

Visit `/test-redis` in your browser, and it should return `Laravel` if Redis is set up properly.

Let me know if you run into any issues during the process!
