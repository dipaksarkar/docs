# Email Deliverability Guide

Email deliverability is the ability to get your emails into recipients' inboxes rather than spam folders or being blocked entirely. This guide explains how to maximize your email deliverability and why using Bouncify helps protect your sender reputation.

---

## Understanding Email Deliverability

Deliverability depends on three key factors:

1. **Technical setup** - Proper authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
2. **Sender reputation** - How mailbox providers view your sending history
3. **Content quality** - What you send and how recipients engage with it

Poor deliverability means your emails get blocked, filtered to spam, or rejected - wasting your marketing efforts and potentially damaging your brand reputation.

## Why List Hygiene Matters

Maintaining a clean email list is essential for deliverability because:

- **High bounce rates** signal to mailbox providers that you're using outdated or poorly sourced lists
- **Spam traps** can get your sending domain or IP blacklisted
- **Inactive subscribers** reduce engagement metrics and harm your sender score
- **Risky addresses** (role-based, disposable) often lead to spam complaints

Bouncify helps you identify and remove these problematic addresses before they damage your sender reputation.

## Best Practices for Email Deliverability

### Authentication & Technical Setup

- Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records

### List Management

- Remove invalid addresses identified by Bouncify
- Segment your "Catch-all" addresses as higher risk
- Never email addresses marked as "Do Not Mail"

- Regularly clean your list (at least quarterly)

### Engagement Optimization

- Send relevant, personalized content
- Maintain consistent sending schedules
- Re-engage inactive subscribers before removing them
- Make unsubscribing easy and honor requests promptly
- Test your emails before sending campaigns

## Warning Signs of Deliverability Issues

- Increasing bounce rates (over 2%)
- Declining open rates
- Rising spam complaints (over 0.1%)

If you notice these warning signs, immediately audit your list with Bouncify and remove problematic addresses.

## Common Deliverability Myths

- **Myth**: One-time list cleaning is sufficient
  **Reality**: Email addresses decay at 2-3% per month; verification should be ongoing

- **Myth**: Low unsubscribe rates mean your list is healthy
  **Reality**: Many subscribers disengage without unsubscribing, becoming "ghost subscribers"

- **Myth**: You can "warm up" a cold list by sending to everyone at once
  **Reality**: This often triggers spam filters; gradually increase volume with your most engaged subscribers
