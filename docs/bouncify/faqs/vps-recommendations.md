# Bouncify VPS Recommendations

This guide offers recommendations for VPS providers and control panels that are compatible with Bouncify. We've tested these providers to ensure they work properly with our application, particularly regarding SMTP port 25 accessibility, which is crucial for email verification.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Always verify if your selected provider supports SMTP port 25 by default before purchasing. Provider policies and regulations may change over time, so we recommend confirming directly with the provider.

## VPS Providers

| Provider | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| **[Contabo](https://www.contabo.com)** | Contabo is popular for its competitive pricing in the cloud industry. Many Bouncify customers use Contabo for their email verification systems.<br><br>**Note:** As of February 2025, some users have reported that Contabo is limiting port 25 outbound traffic. You may need to provide proof of legitimate use to have this limit removed from your account. |
| **[RackNerd](https://www.racknerd.com)** | RackNerd is one of the most affordable VPS service providers with excellent support and impressive Ryzen VPS offerings. They support open port 25 and offer easy rDNS/PTR record setupâ€”simply ask their support team. According to our research, they don't impose rate limiting on port 25 outbound traffic, but it's best to confirm this directly with them. |
| **[DartNode](https://dartnode.com)** | Similar to RackNerd, DartNode appears to have no outbound limit on port 25 traffic, making it suitable for Bouncify installations. As always, we recommend confirming this with their support team before purchasing. |
| **[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com)** | DigitalOcean cloud VPS is another viable option where we've successfully tested Bouncify. They offer extensive community guides and easy rDNS/PTR configuration for your droplets. New users can receive $100 credit for 60 days.<br><br>**Important:** According to DigitalOcean's policy, they do not allow SMTP port 25 on new user accounts. This restriction may be lifted after 60 days by submitting a manual request. Unless you have an established DigitalOcean account, this might not be the best choice for immediate deployment. |
| **[InMotion Hosting](https://www.inmotionhosting.com)** | We've tested Bouncify on InMotion's VPS/Dedicated servers with good results. Since their services come with cPanel/WHM, you'll need to disable mod_security and SMTP firewall to make port 25 accessible. For PTR/rDNS record configuration, simply contact their support team. |
| **[VirMach](https://virmach.com)** | VirMach has been providing VPS services for many years and offers good Linux OS support in KVM environments where Bouncify works smoothly. We recommend using KVM virtualization rather than OpenVZ. We successfully tested Bouncify on their PRO+ KVM package using CentOS 7 with CWP panel. Be aware that their support can be slow and limited. |

## Control Panels

Choosing the right control panel can significantly impact your Bouncify installation experience and performance.

| Control Panel | Recommendation |
|---------------|---------------|
| **[FastPanel](https://fastpanel.direct/)** | FastPanel offers a streamlined interface that works well with Bouncify. Many of our clients using RackNerd VPS pair it with FastPanel for optimal performance. |
| **[HestiaCP](https://www.hestiacp.com/)** | HestiaCP is a lightweight panel forked from VestaCP, supporting Debian and Ubuntu. It features PHP-FPM and has an active community. For Bouncify to work optimally, you'll need to modify the default MySQL configuration to remove timeout limits for long-running queries during bulk email verification processes. Overall, it's simple, fast, and user-friendly. |
| **[CentOS WebPanel (CWP)](https://control-webpanel.com/)** | We found CWP very user-friendly with numerous easily-configurable services. Its interface is similar to cPanel, and while it offers a free version, PHP-FPM is only available in the paid version. |
| **[cPanel & WHM](https://cpanel.net/)** | cPanel & WHM is a premium panel that may be included as an addon with your VPS or can be installed manually with a license. It's user-friendly and compatible with Bouncify, but you'll need to manually disable the SMTP firewall from WHM to enable Port 25 communication. |
| **[Virtualmin](https://www.virtualmin.com/)** | Virtualmin/Webmin is available in both paid and free versions. While it uses minimal system resources, the user interface isn't particularly intuitive, making it better suited for experienced administrators. Due to its complexity in setup and use, we don't recommend it for most Bouncify installations. |

## Configuration Tips for Email Verification

Regardless of which VPS provider and control panel you choose, these configuration tips will help optimize your Bouncify installation:

1. **SMTP Port Configuration**:
   - Ensure port 25 is open for outbound connections
   - Configure proper reverse DNS (PTR) records for your IP addresses
   - Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for your domain

2. **Firewall Settings**:
   - Disable ModSecurity rules that might block SMTP connections
   - Configure firewall rules to allow required connection types

3. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Allocate sufficient RAM for PHP processes (at least 4GB recommended)
   - Configure MySQL for handling long-running queries
   - Enable PHP-FPM for better performance

4. **IP Reputation Management**:
   - Follow [IP warming procedures](/bouncify/faqs/what-is-ip-warming) for new servers
   - Monitor your IP reputation through blacklist checking tools
   - Implement proper rate limiting to avoid triggering spam filters
