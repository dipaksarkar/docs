# What is IP Warming?

IP warming is the process of gradually increasing the volume of emails sent through a new IP address to establish a positive sending reputation with Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

## Why IP Warming Is Important

When you start sending emails from a new IP address, ISPs don't have any sending history to evaluate your reputation. If you immediately send large volumes of emails, ISPs may view this behavior as suspicious and potentially flag your messages as spam.

Key benefits of proper IP warming include:

- **Improved Deliverability**: Gradually builds trust with ISPs to ensure your emails reach the inbox
- **Reduced Bounces**: Minimizes the risk of your emails being rejected
- **Better Sender Reputation**: Establishes a positive sending history
- **Higher Engagement Rates**: When emails reach the inbox, recipients are more likely to engage

## How IP Warming Works

The IP warming process typically follows these stages:

1. **Start Small**: Begin by sending a low volume of emails to your most engaged subscribers
2. **Gradual Increase**: Systematically increase your sending volume over time
3. **Monitor Performance**: Closely track deliverability metrics and engagement rates
4. **Adjust as Needed**: Modify your sending strategy based on performance data

## Recommended IP Warming Schedule

Here's a general guideline for warming up a new IP address:

| Day | Daily Email Volume | Target Audience |
| --- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| 1-2 | 50-100 | Your most engaged subscribers |
| 3-5 | 500-1,000 | Engaged subscribers from the past 30 days |
| 6-10 | 5,000-10,000 | Engaged subscribers from the past 60 days |
| 11-14 | 10,000-20,000 | Engaged subscribers from the past 90 days |
| 15-21 | 20,000-40,000 | Broader audience segment |
| 22-30 | 40,000-100,000 | Full audience with good engagement history |

## Best Practices During IP Warming

Follow these recommendations to ensure a successful IP warming process:

- **Send to Your Most Engaged Subscribers First**: Start with subscribers who consistently open and click your emails
- **Maintain Consistent Sending Patterns**: Send at the same time each day
- **Monitor Key Metrics**: Track bounce rates, spam complaints, and engagement rates
- **Focus on Quality Content**: Ensure your emails provide value to recipients
- **Authenticate Your Domain**: Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
- **Keep Your Lists Clean**: Remove invalid or inactive email addresses

## Common IP Warming Mistakes to Avoid

- **Sending Too Much Too Soon**: Rapidly increasing volume can trigger spam filters
- **Inconsistent Sending Patterns**: Irregular sending creates distrust with ISPs
- **Ignoring Engagement Metrics**: Not adjusting strategy based on performance data
- **Using Poor Quality Lists**: Sending to old or purchased lists damages your reputation
- **Neglecting Authentication**: Failing to properly set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
