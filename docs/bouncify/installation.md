## Server Requirements

To run **Bouncify** efficiently, ensure that your server meets the following requirements. These include the web server, PHP version, necessary extensions, and database requirements. For more detailed specifications, please review our comprehensive [Server Requirements Guide](/bouncify/faqs/server-requirements).

#### Web Server
- **Apache**, **nginx**, or any other compatible web server.

#### PHP Requirements
- **PHP Version**: >= 8.3 (Recommended: Latest stable release of PHP 8.3 or 8.4)
- **Required PHP Extensions**:
  - **BCMath**
  - **Ctype**
  - **cURL**
  - **DOM**
  - **Fileinfo**
  - **JSON**
  - **Mbstring**
  - **OpenSSL**
  - **PCRE**
  - **PDO**
  - **SQLite**
  - **Tokenizer**
  - **XML**
  - **ionCube LoaderÂ® v13.0** (Ensure the latest version is installed and compatible with your PHP version)

#### Database
- **MySQL**: Latest version recommended (minimum MySQL 5.7 or MariaDB 10.2)

#### Recommended Configurations
For optimal performance:
- Use **nginx** as the web server for faster performance and scalability.
- Enable **Opcache** to improve PHP execution speed.
- Allocate sufficient memory (`memory_limit`) in your `php.ini` file (e.g., 1024M or higher).

#### Verify Your Server Setup
Run the following command to check your PHP environment and confirm required extensions are enabled:

```bash
php -m
```

This command will list all installed PHP modules. Cross-check it with the list above to ensure compatibility.

::: warning
This project utilizes the latest Laravel version (currently 11.x). Refer to the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) for more information.

The root folder for Laravel is `/public`. Do not install it in a sub-folder; using a sub-domain is preferable over a sub-folder. We do not support installing our product in a sub-folder.

1. **Create Database and Upload Files**
  - Upload all files into the root folder of your hosting (typically `public_html`)

2. **Start Installation**
  - Navigate to `your-domain-name.com/install` to begin the installation process.
  - Follow the step-by-step installation wizard:

    ### Step 1: System and Requirements Check

    In this first step, the installer performs two important checks:

    **System Requirements**
    - Verifies PHP version (8.2 or higher)
    - Checks required PHP extensions
    - Validates server configurations
    
    **Directory Permissions**
    - Ensures critical directories are writable
    - Confirms file permissions are correctly set
    
    All items should display a green checkmark. If you see any red indicators, you'll need to resolve these issues before continuing.

    ### Step 2: Application & Database Setup

    Here you'll configure the core settings for your application:

    **Application Settings**
    - **Application Name**: Choose a name for your Bouncify installation
    - **Admin Email**: This will be your administrator login
    - **License Key**: Enter your valid license key (purchased directly from our website)

    **Database Configuration**
    - **Database Name**: The name of your MySQL database
    - **Database Username**: Your database username
    - **Database Password**: Your database password
    - **Host**: Usually "localhost" unless using a remote database
    - **Port**: Default is 3306 for MySQL

    ### Step 3: Installation Process

    During this step, the installer will:
    - Connect to your database
    - Create required tables
    - Import initial data
    - Configure core settings
    - Set up required services

    The progress bar shows the current installation status. This process typically takes 30-60 seconds depending on your server.

## Add Cron Jobs

Cron jobs are scheduled tasks that run at predefined times or intervals on your server. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks such as running scripts, performing maintenance, or triggering specific actions at set times.

To set up cron jobs for Bouncify, add the following lines to your server's crontab:

```bash
# Find your PHP path using 'which php' command and replace as needed
* * * * * /usr/bin/env php {project-root}/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Replace `{project-root}` with the actual path to your Bouncify project. The `/usr/bin/env php` approach works across most systems, but you can specify the full path to your PHP version if needed (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/php` or `/usr/bin/php8.2`).

## Post Installation

After completing the installation, refer to the [Post Installation Guide](./post-installation.md) for additional setup steps and best practices to ensure your Bouncify site runs smoothly.
