## Payments
Make sure that you understand the payment process. When a customer checks out, they can choose to pay for their order using any of the methods that you've activated in the Payment providers area of your admin. You can activate a variety of payment methods.

There are a few different things to consider when you're choosing which payment methods to offer. If you want to let your customers pay using a credit card, then you can use Stripe Payments or a third-party provider.

There are also several ways for customers to pay online without using a credit card, such as PayPal, Razorpay, Amazon Pay, and Apple Pay.
