#   Setting up your locations
To make sure your inventory quantities are accurate, online orders and in-person sales are assigned to locations. If some of your inventory is out of stock at one location, but it’s in stock at another location, then you can use to split the order so that it can be fulfilled from multiple locations.

If you make sales from physical locations using the POS, then you can add a location to your sales device to track your inventory accurately.

##  Add a location

**Steps:**

1.  From your admin, go to `Settings > Locations`.
2.  Click `Add location`.
3.  Enter a unique name and an address for the location.
4.  Click `Done`.

##  Deactivate a location
You can deactivate a location temporarily or permanently if you don't want to sell, fulfill, or stock inventory at that location.

When you deactivate a location, it’s no longer shown on filters and menus, you can no longer manage inventory in the location, and you can't use it as your default location. You always need to have at least one active location.

You can’t deactivate the location that's currently set as your default location. You first need to change the default location to another location.

Before you deactivate a location, you need to complete all orders and transfers that are assigned to it, and reassign them to another location. If you don’t, then you’ll be prompted to fulfill the orders and have the inventory quantities reassigned.

**Steps:**

1.  From your admin, go to `Settings > Locations`.
2.  Click the location that you want to deactivate.
3.  Uncheck the box labeled `Active`.
4.  If any inventory, orders, or transfers are assigned to this location, then select another location to move the inventory to.
5.  Click `Done`.

##  Reactivate a location
You can reactivate a location that you previously deactivated and continue fulfilling orders from this location.

**Steps:**

1.  From your admin, go to `Settings > Locations`.
2.  Click the location that you want to reactivate.
3.  Check the box labeled `Active`.
5.  Click `Done`.
