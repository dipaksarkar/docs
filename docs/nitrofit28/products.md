# Products

Your products are the goods, digital downloads, and services that you sell. You add a product in NitroFIT28 by entering product details and uploading product images. If your product has options, like size or color, then you can add a variant for each combination of options.

When you are adding or updating a product, you can make the product available to one or more of your sales channels.

You view, add, update, and organize all of your products and variants from the Products page in the NitroFIT28 admin.
