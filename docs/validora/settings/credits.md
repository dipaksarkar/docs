# Credit plans

The plan's general information section manages membership fees and descriptions for effective communication with potential and existing members.

- `Label` - Name or label of the plan.
- `Custom Billing Period` - Option to set a custom billing period for the plan.
- `Renewal fee` - Renewal fee for the plan. Once the plan is created, the monthly fee cannot be changed.
- `Description` - Brief description of the plan.
- `Note` - Additional notes or comments about the plan.
- `Active` - Indicates whether the plan is currently active or not.
- `Features` - Features included in the plan. Credit plans may restrict the number of class bookings or guest passes to ensure fair access, requiring members to upgrade or pay additional fees if they exceed the limit.

## Understanding credit pricing

Credit plans allow members to purchase credits at different price points:

- `Credit` - The number of credits included in the plan.
- `Price` - The total price for the credit package.
- `Price per credit` - Automatically calculated by dividing the price by the number of credits. This helps members compare the value of different plans.

For better plan management, consider creating a range of options with better per-credit value for larger packages to incentivize higher purchases.
