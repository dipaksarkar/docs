# Class schedules
Class Schedules section allows you to manage the schedules for various classes offered by your gym or fitness center. Template class schedules can be used to efficiently change bulk week class schedules.

::: warning
Please be careful when assigning templates. If you remove a week's template or reassign a template all data attached to that current week will be deleted as it will be treated as a new week. This includes bookings and registers connected to it. If you wish to make changes to class details for a particular day/week please use the `Week Schedules` tab.
