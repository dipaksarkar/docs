## Prerequisites

To get started with a Gympify application, ensure you have the following prerequisites for your development machine:

1. **Node 14+ for Quasar CLI with Vite**.
   - To check your Node.js version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
2. **Yarn v1 (strongly recommended)**, PNPM, or NPM.
   - To check your Yarn version, run `yarn -v` in a terminal/console window.

### Installing Quasar CLI

The Quasar CLI is used for project creation, generating application and library code, and various development tasks.

Install the Quasar CLI globally:

```bash
yarn global add @quasar/cli
yarn global add @quasar/icongenie
```

::: warning
On this project, we're using the latest Quasar version (currently 2.x). Please go to [Quasar documentation](https://quasar.dev/start/quasar-cli) page for more information.

#### Web Server
- **Apache**, **nginx**, or any other compatible web server.

#### PHP Requirements
- **PHP Version**: >= 8.2 (Recommended: Latest stable release of PHP 8.2 or 8.3)

This command will list all installed PHP modules. Cross-check it with the list above to ensure compatibility.


::: warning
This project utilizes the latest Laravel version (currently 11.x). Refer to the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) for more information.

The root folder for Laravel is `/public`. Do not install it in a sub-folder; using a sub-domain is preferable over a sub-folder. We do not support installing our product in a sub-folder.
