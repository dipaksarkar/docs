::: warning
This project utilizes the latest Laravel version (currently 12.x). Refer to the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) for more information.

The root folder for Laravel is `/public`. Do not install it in a sub-folder; using a sub-domain is preferable over a sub-folder. We do not support installing our product in a sub-folder.
