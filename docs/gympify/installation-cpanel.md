# Installation

Welcome to the **Gympify Installation Guide**! This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up a basic **Gympify** instance on **cPanel shared hosting**.

::: tip Quick Note
If you're looking to install Gympify on **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**, refer to the [VPS Installation Guide](./installation.md).  
:::

::: warning
While Gympify **can be installed on shared hosting**, for optimal performance and scalability, we highly recommend using a **VPS** or a **dedicated server**. Shared hosting lacks the advanced configuration capabilities required for certain Gympify features.
