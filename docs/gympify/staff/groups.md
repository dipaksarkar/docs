#   Groups
The Groups section allows you to create and manage groups within your store, enabling you to organize users with similar roles or permissions.

-   `Name` - Name of the group (e.g., Admin).
-   `Description` - Brief description or summary of the group's purpose or role.
-   `Permissions` - Assign permissions or access levels to the group. You can give group access to your store by sending them an invitation. If you are working with a designer, developer, or marketer, find out how to give collaborator access to your store.
