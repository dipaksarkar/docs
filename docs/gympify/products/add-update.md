#   Adding and updating products

You can add or update information about a product such as its price, variants, and availability from the `Products` page in your admin.

## Add a new product

**Steps:**

1.   From your admin, go to `Products`.
2.   From the `Products` page, click `Add product`.
3.   Enter a title for your product, along with additional `details`.
4.   Click `Save`.

::: warning
If you have over 50 store locations, then you need to save your product first before adding inventory quantities.
:::   

<!-- ## Duplicate a product
To save time when you add a new product, you can duplicate a similar product. If you want to add options to an existing product, such as color or size, then add a variant to the product instead of duplicating the product.

When you choose to duplicate an existing product, you have the option to make the following adjustments before creating the duplicate: * Set a new title. * Set the product status to `active` or `draft`. * Select which other product details to duplicate from a specific set of options.

::: warning
By default, the `active` status applies to all available sales channels. If you want the duplicated product to be active on specific sales channels, then set the product status to `draft`.
:::

All other product details except 3D models and videos are automatically copied from the original to the duplicate.

**Steps:**

1.   From your admin, go to `Products`.
2.   Click the (`...`) of the product that you want to delete.
3.   Click `Duplicate`.
4.   Click `Confirm`.
4.   Enter a title for the duplicate product.
5.   Optional: Select which product details to duplicate.
6.   Optional: Set the product status to `active` to publish the product on all sales channels, or keep the product status as `draft`.
7.   Click `Save` product. -->

##  Edit a product
After you've created products, you can edit them to change their descriptions, prices, and any other product details.

Although you can change your product details at any time, the changes can affect your reports. For information on how the changes can affect your reports, view Changes to product details.

Saved changes take effect immediately in your online store. Before you update a product, you can check the top of the page to check if another staff might also be making changes to the same product.

**Steps:**

1.  From your admin, go to `Products`.
2.  Click the name of the product that you want to change.
3.  Modify the product `details`.
4.  Click `Save`.

## Add or remove tags
Tags are searchable keywords associated with your product. Tags can help customers find your product through your online store search, and you can also use them to create automated collections.

**Steps:**

1.  From your admin, go to `Products`.
2.  Click the name of a product to edit, or `create a new product`.
3.  In the `Organization` section, select or enter tags for your product. Use a comma to separate different tags. Tags can have up to 255 characters.
4.  When you are finished, click `Save`.

##  Edit a search engine listing
You can edit the way that a product displays in search results on the product's details page:

1.  In the `Search engine listing` section, click Edit.
2.  In the `Page title` field, enter a descriptive title. This title will display as a link in search engine results. You can enter up to 70 characters in the title.
3.  Enter a `Meta description` for the search engine listing. Make sure to include relevant keywords for your product to help new customers find your link. You might also want to include your business name. You can enter up to 320 characters in the description.
Note

::: info
The page title and meta description have set character limits. If you enter more text beyond the character limit, then your page title and description will be shortened in search engine results.
:::

4.  In the `URL and handle` section, you can edit the web address. In most cases, you won't need to make changes to the web address. If you do make changes, then make sure that you set up URL redirects from the old web address. The URL can't contain any spaces. Handles are used in theme design.
Click Save.

::: info
The URL and handle are automatically generated when you create a new product. You can edit the handle to make it match your product title, but don't edit it too often or the product might not display in search engine results.
:::

##  Delete a product
You can delete a single product, or delete multiple products at the same time using a bulk action. When you delete a product, it's temporary removed from `Gympify`. Deleted products can be restored.

**To delete a product:**

1.  From your admin, go to `Products`.
2.  Click the (`...`) of the product that you want to delete.
3.  Click `Delete`.
4.  Click `Confirm`.
