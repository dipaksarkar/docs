#  Managing inventory
Inventory is the quantity of a particular product that is available for sale.

Inventory tracking can help you avoid selling products that have run out of stock, or let you know when you need to order or produce more of a product.

You can set up inventory tracking, view your inventory, and adjust your inventory levels in the Inventory area of `Gympify`. You can also view the history of inventory adjustments for products and variants whose inventory is being tracked by `Gympify`. You can analyze changes to inventory levels in the Inventory Reports section of `Gympify`.
