#   Orders
After a customer places an order using any of your active sales channels, it displays in the Orders area. You can also create orders manually in your admin to record orders that you've to send your customers invoices.

You manage all of your store's orders from the Orders page in your admin.

## Create a order
Create a order on behalf of your customer and then send them an invoice for the order. By default, the invoice contains a link to a checkout, where your customer can pay for their order.

Orders can contain the following information:

-   one or more products
-   discounts
-   applicable taxes
-   a customer

**Steps:**

1. From your admin, go to `Orders`.
2. Click `Create order`. 
3. Add products to the order.
4. Customize the order:
    -   Add a customer
    -   Apply discounts
    -   Turn taxes on or off
5. Do one of the following actions:
   -   `Send an invoice` to the customer. By default, the invoice contains a link to a checkout that your customer can use to pay for the order.
   -   `Accept payment` from the customer.

Save the order so that you can update it later from the `Orders` page.
You can also create orders with pre-filled customer information from existing customer profiles.

## Add products

1. Open the order from the `Orders` page in your admin.
2. In the `Products` section, do any of the following:
    -   Enter the name of the product that you want to add to your order.
    -   Click `Browse` to view a list of your store's products and collections.
    -   Create a custom item for the order by clicking `Add custom product`.
3. Select the individual products or variants that you want to include in the order.
4. Click `Add`. To remove a product from the order, click the `X` button beside it in the Products section.
5. Check the quantity that you have added to the order. If you add a product that has an inventory of zero and the product doesn't allow overselling, then you receive a message warning you of a stock problem if you manually collect a payment or specify payment terms. Customers trying to check out are notified that the item is out of stock and can't complete the sale.
