##  Understanding credit pricing

Credit plans allow members to purchase credits at different price points:

-   `Credit` - The number of credits included in the plan.
-   `Price` - The total price for the credit package.
-   `Price per credit` - Automatically calculated by dividing the price by the number of credits. This helps members compare the value of different plans.

For better plan management, consider creating a range of options with better per-credit value for larger packages to incentivize higher purchases.
