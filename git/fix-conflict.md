This conflict occurs when files are deleted in one branch (e.g., `HEAD`) but modified or renamed in another (e.g., `master`). To resolve these conflicts by keeping the changes from `master` and discarding the deletions in `HEAD`, follow these steps:

### Steps to Accept All Changes from `master`
1. **Checkout the conflicted files** from `master`:
   Use the following command for each file:
   ```bash
   git checkout --ours <file_path>
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   git checkout --ours public/assets/native.883e30f1.js
   ```

   Repeat this for all the conflicted files listed.

2. **Mark the conflicts as resolved**:
   After checking out the `master` versions, mark the conflicts as resolved:
   ```bash
   git add <file_path>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   git add public/assets/native.883e30f1.js
   ```

3. **Automate the process for all conflicted files**:
   If there are many files, you can automate this with a loop:
   ```bash
   git ls-files -u | awk '{print $4}' | xargs git checkout --ours
   git ls-files -u | awk '{print $4}' | xargs git add
   ```

4. **Commit the resolved changes**:
   Once all conflicts are resolved, commit the changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved conflicts by keeping changes from master"
   ```

5. **Continue the merge or rebase**:
   If you're in the middle of a merge or rebase, continue the process:
   ```bash
   git merge --continue
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

### Additional Notes
- **For future conflicts**, consider ignoring generated files (e.g., `public/assets/*`) by adding them to `.gitignore` if they are built dynamically.
- **Verify the resolution** by checking the functionality of your project after resolving conflicts to ensure nothing critical was missed.
